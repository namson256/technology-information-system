ASSIGMENT AND PROJECT
---------------------

o Assignment 1 (Industry Talk with PPG and Habib)

I learned fresh information about the working world at this talk, and the seniors who have already graduated from UTM with a bachelor's degree in computer science (data engineering), much like me, gave us advice on how to become employable.

o Assignment 2 (Industry visit UTM Digital)

After the industrial tour at UTM Digital, I can now picture my future as a data engineer or in any field involving servers and data much more clearly. this is because we had the chance to tour a data center and learn how to maintain the servers there. This has increased my desire to study computer science.
