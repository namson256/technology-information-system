# Technology Information System

ASSIGMENT AND PROJECT
---------------------

o Assignment 1 (Industry Talk with PPG and Habib)

I learned fresh information about the working world at this talk, and the seniors who have already graduated from UTM with a bachelor's degree in computer science (data engineering), much like me, gave us advice on how to become employable.

o Assignment 2 (Industry visit UTM Digital)

After the industrial tour at UTM Digital, I can now picture my future as a data engineer or in any field involving servers and data much more clearly. this is because we had the chance to tour a data center and learn how to maintain the servers there. This has increased my desire to study computer science.

After listening to the industry discussion, I feel like I have a clearer idea of how I want to work in the future and what needs to be done to get ready to become a professional data engineer, like learning Python and SQL. The desire to learn something new and explore the technology on your own comes next because, as you are aware, technology has advanced dramatically and, as a student of data engineering, you must pursue lifelong learning to ensure your relevance in the field. Finally, never give up on what you are currently doing, and make every effort to ensure your success in the end.

o Assignment 4 (Industry Visit Petronas and Huawei)

I now know a great deal about the business world and how to remain relevant. we also had the chance to speak with a software engineering specialist, who gave us someÂ helpful advice about how to guarantee we could keep our employment in the future. This has given me an idea of what my future profession may look like. We also had the chance to tour a Huawei product workshop, which is filled with a ton of cutting-edge gadgets and innovative technologies. This leads me to believe that to stay current with the advancement of new technology, I must constantly acquire new knowledge.

o PC Assemble

A computer science student needs to be knowledgeable in everything related to computers, not simply programming and application creation. Thus, in this PC assembly section, we have learned how to assemble and reassemble the computer. I now know how to remove the RAM, power supply, and many other components. I think I'm a passable computer science student with this talent.

o Design Thinking (Final project)

Throughout the process of completing this design thinking assignment, I have learned new information about the computer science and IT industries. In order to turn in my work on time, I also master time management skills. Finally, given our task involves cloud computing and we have to implement certain current systems, my critical thinking skills have significantly improved.
