ASSIGMENT AND PROJECT
---------------------

o Assignment 1 (Industry Talk with PPG and Habib)

I learned fresh information about the working world at this talk, and the seniors who have already graduated from UTM with a bachelor's degree in computer science (data engineering), much like me, gave us advice on how to become employable.

o Assignment 2 (Industry visit UTM Digital)

After the industrial tour at UTM Digital, I can now picture my future as a data engineer or in any field involving servers and data much more clearly. this is because we had the chance to tour a data center and learn how to maintain the servers there. This has increased my desire to study computer science.

o Assignment 3 (Format: Report)

o Assignment 4 (Industry Visit Petronas and Huawei)

I now know a great deal about the business world and how to remain relevant. we also had the chance to speak with a software engineering specialist, who gave us someÂ helpful advice about how to guarantee we could keep our employment in the future. This has given me an idea of what my future profession may look like. We also had the chance to tour a Huawei product workshop, which is filled with a ton of cutting-edge gadgets and innovative technologies. This leads me to believe that to stay current with the advancement of new technology, I must constantly acquire new knowledge.
